## Directions for transfering MSMIP simulation output to NCAR via Globus
#### Rich Neale, NCAR: 29 April, 2022

1. Set up globus id
2. Contact Rich Neale (rneale@ucar.edu) requesting access to the NCAR MSMIP upload collection space
3. In globus search for the 'MSMIP Data Share' collection
4. Connect to your local or institutional Globus end node
5. Transfer data into simulation/< your institution> directory
6. Send email to Rich Neale (rneale@ucar.edu) confiriming your transfer or if you have problems (I have heard of firewall-type probems before)
