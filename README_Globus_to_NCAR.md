## Directions for transfering MSMIP simulation output to NCAR via Globus
#### Rich Neale, NCAR: 29 April, 2022

1. Set up a globus id
2. Contact Rich Neale (rneale@ucar.edu) requesting access to the NCAR MSMIP upload collection space (provide your correct globus/email)
3. In globus search for the 'MSMIP Data Share' collection
4. Connect to your local or institutional Globus end node
5. Transfer data into simulation/< your institution> directory on the MSMIP Data Share end node
6. Send email to Rich Neale (rneale@ucar.edu) confiriming your transfer or if you have problems (I have heard of firewall-type probems before)
